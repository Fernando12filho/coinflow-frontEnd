# CoinFlow - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the CoinFlow application. CoinFlow allows users to track their cryptocurrency investments, view market trends, and manage transaction history with a focus on ease of use and accessibility.

## Table of Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Technologies](#technologies)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The frontend connects to the CoinFlow backend API to provide the following features:
- User authentication (login and signup)
- Display user’s assets and transaction history
- Real-time news and market trends related to cryptocurrency

### Configuration

Update the `baseURL` in `App.js` to match the backend API’s URL if different from the default (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

### Backend (Flask)

#### `README.md` for Backend

```markdown
# CoinFlow - Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the CoinFlow application. It serves as the primary data provider for CoinFlow's frontend, handling user authentication, asset management, transaction history, and news feeds.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints)
- [Technologies](#technologies)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

The backend API will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Configuration

Ensure CORS is enabled in `__init__.py` for smooth communication between the frontend and backend. You may update the allowed origins as per your requirements.

## Usage

The backend provides several endpoints for:
- User session management (login, signup)
- Retrieving and managing assets and transactions
- Displaying news and market data

## API Endpoints

Here is an overview of the key endpoints:

| Endpoint                  | Method | Description                              |
|---------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `/api/user/login`         | POST   | Logs in a user                           |
| `/api/user/register`      | POST   | Registers a new user                     |
| `/api/user/session`       | GET    | Verifies user session                    |
| `/api/user/investments`   | GET    | Retrieves user’s investment details      |
| `/api/news`               | GET    | Fetches real-time news and market trends |
